# Todo List

### DoT metrics
> - Remove "clipped ticks" stat
> - Replace it with some measure of "Lost GCDs", e.g. to measure the impact of recasting early, when those GCDs
  could have been used for other damage abilities, like an extra tick of Mind Flay.

### Haste
> - Investigate:
>   - Can we determine haste rating or effective haste % per cast from log data?

### Testing
> - Create integration test with canned JSON data for a given log
> - Pass through `LogsService` and analyzers and test results
> - Template tests
