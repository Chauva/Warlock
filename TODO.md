# Todo List

### Haste
> - Investigate:
>   - confirm that current stats are not impacted by changes in player haste
>   - Can we determine haste rating or effective haste % per cast from log data?

### Testing
> - Create integration test with canned JSON data for a given log
> - Pass through `LogsService` and analyzers and test results
> - Template tests
